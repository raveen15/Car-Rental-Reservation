ROS Luxury Car Rentals
In order to run this project on your Windows PC, a local server must be installed and linked to a MySQL Workbench.
After doing so, implement the tables that are given in the database table folder.
Afterthat, make sure that the localhost server/port number, username, password matches with your database connection to all the php files.
In our database connection, the database host, username, password are "localhost:3306, root, root", but it can be modified at your convenience. 
Once that is done, save all the files into a folder where it can be accessed by the local server.
Once the local server is connected, apply the directory to where the folder is saved and access the registration.php (localhost/carRental/registration.php).
